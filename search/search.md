# Search

Internet search engines are an interesting topic and something that plays a big role in all our lives. I like to think that I do research every day.

## How I do searches

The most useful thing that has helped me be more productive in uncovering new and interesting things is to do things with a purpose.This includes research.

As for the research itself, I use all the tools available to me to answer a question I have. I love using macOS dictionary app to quickly go and read a wiki article. It is amazing how fast it lets me both search for things there and simply explore the depth of the wiki.

For searching, I use:

- [Google](https://google.com) - General / programming related.
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) - Private searches / instant answers / cheat sheets.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - Software / repos / code search

There is also absolutely amazing workflow to [search various websites with autosuggestions](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio). I highly recommend it. It essentially lets you have powerful search like Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube and more from wherever you are in your operating system.

## Super fast access to all knowledge of the world

It's insane, the world we live in.

We have all the knowledge of every human who has ever lived or lives now at our disposal. Not many people do share all their knowledge in a continuous way like I do here but most people share it through their blogs. Their code, videos, tweets and other mediums.
