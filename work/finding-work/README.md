# Finding Work

I use [Otta](https://otta.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) & [AngelList](https://angel.co) and the [monthly HN: Who is hiring? threads](https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/) for finding interesting work opportunities to apply to.

I want to make [my CV](https://github.com/josephgattuso/cv/blob/master/README.md) using [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template in [LaTex](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/LaTeX/).

Sometimes the most effective way to apply is to apply directly. Go to the website of the company you want to apply to and see if there is a Jobs section present somewhere and apply through it.

I use a similar message for all my direct emails:

```text
Hi {name},

I saw you're looking for a {role} at {company} and I'm interested in joining your team.

{Why I want to join and think I am good fit..}

I attached my CV for further information, let me know if you'd be interested in talking.

```

My other favourite way of finding interesting work opportunities is meeting and interacting with people personally through various events and getting to know what they're building.

## Notes

- Sort by newest jobs in websites and check regularly and apply then.
- If asked previous salary, you can [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/9ohap7/uk_company_asking_about_current_salary_up_front/): `As per contract, I'm not at liberty to disclose this.`
