> Never let impostor syndrome or anything else stop you from applying to your dream jobs. Most requirements placed on the job boards are not set in stone. If you know how to learn fast and know things already that are related, apply! Don't let rejections discourage you, ever. It's a numbers game and the first jobs are always the hardest to get.
